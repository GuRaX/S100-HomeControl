=>  0x01 General Information  <=

These project should be a kind of embedded computer for your home to control
what ever you want from one computer or may be even your Iphone or Android 
phone.
We connect a ATmega8 via USB and use the I/O pins to communicate to I2C devices, 
One Wire devices, other simple serial devices via TxD and RxD or use them as 
basic I/O pins to control a relay for the light or control the jalousie.


=>  0x02 Hardware  <=
We use some basic hardware for our testing because it is relatively cheap.
This is only the hardware where we test our HomeControl, the hardware that is
required for the ATmega8 and so on is extra.


==>  a. Required Hardware  <==
As said before we test the project on a T-Online Vision S100 with Ubuntu Server 
in version 9.04. The System runs from a additional HDD or from a USB flash drive.


==>  b. Additional Hardware  <==
All other additional hardware parts are part of this software and are not 
necessary, only if you want to make that part where they are used.
More information about the hardware should be available un the PCB folder.
